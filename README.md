# bookbot

BookBot is my first Python project!

This was my result of Boot.dev's first guided project in the course '4. Build a Bookbot'.

It may not be the most elegant piece of coding ever done, but I think I followed the instructions well, and ended up changing a few of my initial solutions to better match the more efficient and readable solutions they gave. 

## A few things I learnt:
1. The main() function maybe shouldn't have any of it's own operations to perform but should just collect the outputs of the other functions in the file.
2. Shorter variable names, while maybe not as descriptive, are definitely easier to type and more difficult to mistype! Need to strike a balance between length and descriptiveness.
3. One function doesn't have to do everything, better to have multiple functions that each do one thing. Makes it easier to debug errors and potentially re-use functions in the future (I imagine).

## A few things I'm proud of:
1. I think I followed (once I remembered) the general rules for a good git commit well. The lessons made for easy points to commit, and I think I made clear git commit messages with some additional description when needed.
2. I made good use of Boots and Google to find solutions without using a Seer Stone to peek at the solution beforehand. I definitely got a little sidetracked at one point looked at the method for `sorted()` but got to the final result eventaully and was proud that it was similar to the solution. (Though I initally had the function to sort the list in the `main()` portion and adjusted that)
3. I finished a project!!
